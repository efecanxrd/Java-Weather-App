<h2> How this is working? </h2>
<h4> In the example, a request is sent to the wttr.in service for the city of Ankara. The response of the service is received using the %C (weather condition), %t (temperature) and %H (humidity) formats. The received response is stored as a string using the StringBuilder class and eventually printed.

This example is just one way to use the wttr.in service to get weather information. Other services can be used or different data formats can be received.
